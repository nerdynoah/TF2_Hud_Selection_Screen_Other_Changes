# TF2_Hud_Selection_Screen_Other_Changes
What did I Change:
 AMMO and HP are below the crosshair. Engineer's metal has been moved closer to the center. Recolored the HP to green texts, Recolored MAX HP to blue, Removed HP's Backgrounds, Status Effects are near the center ,Demoman, Sniper, and Medic have SOME of their meters moved above the crosshair. Moved some other things closer to the center
 
 When 125 HP classes reach 113, the Low health Trigger will go off. While this has some undiserd effects for buffer health classes, the REALISTIC one-shot threshold has appeared for 125-150 HP classes.

 Class Selection HUD has been ENTIERLY CHANEGD
 
 Generalists: Scout, Soldier, Demoman
